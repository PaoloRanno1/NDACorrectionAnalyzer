**[Confidentiality Agreement - Project ZENITH]{.underline}**

Deloitte Financial Advisory GmbH (in the following "Deloitte FA") will
provide us with certain information (in the following "Information")
regarding a potential investment in ESS Engineering Software Steyr GmbH,
a company active in the Simulation Software industry (in the following
"Company") after the signing of this Confidentiality Agreement.

The Information includes information that is non-public and confidential
together with analyses, compilations, studies or other documents
prepared by Deloitte FA and/or the Company, which contain or otherwise
reflect such information that will be provided to us or our
representatives.

We agree to keep all Information concerning the Company, which we are
provided by Deloitte FA and/or the Company in oral, written or
electronic form, strictly confidential.

In consideration for providing us with the Information, we agree that

1.  we will not disclose any such Information or knowledge to any person
    or other corporate body, other than to our or our affiliates'
    directors, officers and senior employees and our financing providers
    and advisers, that are bound to discretion, who are demonstrably
    directly concerned with our appraisal of the Company or part of it.
    We will procure that each person to whom such disclosure in whatever
    mode is made shall adhere to the terms of this Confidentiality
    Agreement in writing as if he or she were a party thereto;

2.  we will make no copies or reproduction of the Information supplied
    of any type whatsoever without the prior written consent of Deloitte
    FA. This provision does not include copies for the persons described
    in paragraph (1). Furthermore, we assure that all information or
    data received, including copies, will be immediately deleted or
    destroyed as soon as we decide not to proceed with the evaluation of
    the acquisition opportunity or the process is terminated by us, by
    the company or by the seller for other reasons. In such a case,
    Deloitte FA shall be informed immediately of this decision and the
    destruction of the information or data.

3.  we will take adequate organizational measures to ensure that the
    Information is kept confidential and to ensure that the disclosure
    of Information is limited to the persons described in paragraph (1)
    (e.g. through password protection, no interlinking of servers);

4.  we will not directly or indirectly contact the shareholders, the
    management, the employees, the suppliers, the creditors and the
    customers of the Company unless we have received a prior written
    authorization from Deloitte FA;

5.  we will not use the Information and any knowledge derived from it
    for any other purpose than to evaluate the Company and to prepare an
    offer for the acquisition of the Company (prohibition of use). We
    will not use the Information for our own purposes or for the
    purposes of third parties or otherwise make use of it (prohibition
    of utilization); this shall not apply to publicly available
    information or information, which was provided to us by a third
    party without any breach of a confidentiality obligation and without
    any breach of the present duty of confidentiality, or as to which we
    are able to prove that we had already held the information prior to
    the date of signing of the Confidentiality Agreement or acquired or
    developed it independently thereof;

6.  we will not directly solicit the employment of any manager or
    employee of the Company. This provision shall not include employees
    that independently and without being influenced by us (a) respond to
    any general solicitation or advertisement made by us or (b) submit
    their application to a professional recruitment agency engaged by
    us;

7.  we will not make any statements to business partners of the Company
    and to mass media (newspapers, magazines, radio, TV, internet
    homepage, etc.) concerning the planned transaction;

8.  exceptions to the foregoing non-disclosure obligations are cases in
    which Information (a) must be disclosed pursuant to statutory or
    regulatory rules, provided that Deloitte FA is notified promptly of
    this requirement and that the scope of the disclosure is restricted
    to the maximum extent possible, or (b) based on a court decision,
    such Information must be disclosed, provided that Deloitte FA is
    notified promptly of such decision and provided that there is no
    possibility of challenging such court decision;

9.  we understand that Deloitte FA and the Company have endeavored to
    include in the Information those materials which they believe to be
    reliable and relevant for the purpose of our evaluation, but we
    acknowledge that neither Deloitte FA nor the Company, make any
    representation or warranty, either expressed or implied, as to the
    accuracy, actuality or completeness of the Information;

10. we explicitly waive any right to claim for damages based on culpa in
    contrahendo (or any similar legal grounds);

11. we will be held liable for any breach of this Confidentiality
    Agreement by ourselves, our employees and any third party to which
    we have disclosed any Information and we will hold harmless the
    Company and Deloitte FA from and against any claims, damages,
    losses, costs or expenses (including attorney's fees and
    disbursements) arising out of any breach of this Confidentiality
    Agreement;

12. the provisions of this Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate
    three years from that date of this Confidentiality Agreement, unless
    we receive prior written consent from Deloitte FA;

13. this Confidentiality Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
    accordance with substantive Austrian law. We agree that the
    commercial court of Vienna, Austria, shall have exclusive
    jurisdiction to hear and decide any suit, action or proceedings, and
    to settle any disputes, which may arise out of or in connection with
    this Confidentiality Agreement.

With regard to the intended sales process we, explicitly agree and
accept that:

1.  There is no obligation on the part of the Company or its Shareholder
    > or Deloitte FA to accept any offer or proposal received from us.
    > The Company, its Shareholder and Deloitte FA reserve the right

- to interrupt, modify or terminate the transaction process at any time,

- to negotiate at any time with one or several parties irrespective of
  > whether or not they are participating in the transaction,

- to enter into a final agreement on a transaction, an exclusivity
  > agreement or similar arrangement without informing other potential
  > investors interested in the transaction or any similar arrangement
  > beforehand.

2.  The Company, its Shareholder and Deloitte FA do not assume any
    > responsibility for the actual occurrence of the intended
    > transaction or continuation of the process. In particular, any
    > claims for damages based on the alleged violation of
    > pre-contractual obligations (culpa in contrahendo) or any similar
    > legal grounds against the Company, its Shareholder, Deloitte FA or
    > any of their respective affiliates, management, employees or
    > advisors shall be expressly excluded. Any obligations on the part
    > of the Company or its Shareholder, as applicable, will only arise
    > upon execution of documentation on a definitive transaction (e.g.
    > execution of a purchase agreement). It is understood that each
    > potential investor shall bear the costs relating to its own
    > evaluation of the transaction, which shall include fees and
    > disbursements of professional advisors. The Company, its
    > Shareholder and Deloitte FA do not assume any responsibility for
    > costs and other expenses of the potential investor incurred during
    > the participation in this process, including but not limited to
    > costs in connection with preparing and submitting an offer.
