Non-disclosure of confidential information

We have had preliminary discussions about evaluating a potential
investment in a Maritime Technology Company ("the **Company**"). Both of
us intend to enter into further discussions relating to the Project and,
in connection with the Project and in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this letter, both of us are willing to exchange between us
certain confidential information. This letter relates to information at
any time and from time to time supplied by one of us or any of our
respective Affiliates (the "**Discloser**") orally, in writing or in any
other form to the other or its Authorised Recipients (the
"**Recipient**") in connection with the Project (the "**Information**").
