    Proposed Transaction or any other form of commitment on the part of
    the Sellers or the Company.

12. It is understood that the Sellers and the Company shall be free
    hereunder to conduct any process with respect to the Proposed

    each day, or part of a day, that such infringement continues after
    the first day of infringement without prejudice to the Company's
    right to claim additional damages, if it can establish that it has
    incurred losses exceeding this amount. The parties to this Agreement
    acknowledge that the provisions of this section are reasonable and
    necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the Company.

    remaining provisions contained herein shall not be affected or
    impaired thereby. Any provision of this Agreement which is invalid,
    illegal or unenforceable shall be replaced by the parties to this
    Agreement by a provision that is valid, legal or enforceable and of

    provision that it substitutes.

25. This Agreement and all non-contractual obligations arising out of or
    in connection with it, are governed by and shall be construed in
    accordance with Belgian law. Any dispute arising out of or in
