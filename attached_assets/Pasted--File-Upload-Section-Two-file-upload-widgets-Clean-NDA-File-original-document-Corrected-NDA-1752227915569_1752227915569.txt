Code Integration Guidelines
Using Provided Classes
The three provided Python files contain these key classes:

TestingChain from Clean_testing.py (main orchestrator)
NDAComplianceChain from NDA_HR_review_chain.py (HR analysis)
StradaComplianceChain from NDA_Review_chain.py (AI review)

Key Methods to Integrate

TestingChain.analyze_testing(clean_path, corrected_path) - Full analysis
TestingChain.quick_testing(ai_json, hr_json) - Direct comparison
TestingChain.save_results() - Export functionality

Streamlit-Specific Adaptations

Use st.file_uploader() instead of file paths
Handle uploaded files with tempfile for processing
Use st.session_state to cache results and avoid re-processing
Implement st.spinner() and st.progress() for user feedback
