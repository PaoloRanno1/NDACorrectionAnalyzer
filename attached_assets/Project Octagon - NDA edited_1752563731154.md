Dear Mr **Nicholas**,

In view of the interest that has been expressed by you in a possible
acquisition (the '**Proposed Transaction**') of [\[● Target\]]{.mark}
(the '**Company'**, together with its subsidiaries, the '**Group**',
hereafter also referred to '**Project Octagon**') either Corporate
Finance Benelux B.V. ('**CFI'**), the Group and/or the owner(s) of the
Group (the '**Seller(s)**') (the Group, CFI and the Seller(s) and/or any
of their affiliates from time to time, including their
advisors/representatives, together: the '**Providers**' and each a
'**Provider**') will provide you with information in writing, in
electronic form, orally or otherwise, relating to the Group and/or the
Seller(s) that is not public but confidential and/or owned by the Group
and/or the Seller(s). Moreover, negotiations may be held relating to the
Proposed Transaction. The existence and contents of (a) this
confidentiality agreement, (b) information relating to the Group and/or
the Sellers, supplied to you by the Providers in connection with the
Proposed Transaction, (c) meetings and discussions relating to the
Proposed Transaction, and (d) the Proposed Transaction as such and
negotiations relating to the Proposed Transaction, including, without
limitation, all reports, analyses, compilations, or other documents or
data which contain, derive from or otherwise reflect any information
described in (a), (b), (c) and (d) above (together: the
'**Information**') are all confidential.

In view of the above and in consideration of the Providers agreeing to
supply Information to you, and entering into discussions with you
relating to the Proposed Transaction, we hereby establish in writing
that we both agree to the following:

1.  You acknowledge that the Information is confidential and received by
    you under a duty of confidentiality towards each of the Providers
    and for the exclusive purpose of the evaluation of and the
    discussions and negotiations regarding the Proposed Transaction. You
    undertake not to, at any time, use the Information in any other
    fashion, form or manner or for any other purpose. You commit
    yourself vis-à-vis the Providers to keeping any Information, the
    name of the Group, as well as the purpose and the nature of the
    meetings, discussions and negotiations strictly confidential.

2.  You will treat the Information in accordance with all applicable
    data protection laws.

3.  You acknowledge that the Information will remain the exclusive
    property of the relevant Provider and that no right or license is
    granted to you in relation to the Information other than as
    expressly set forth in this confidentiality agreement. No
    intellectual property rights in respect of any trade secret,
    copyright, or other right of the Group or the Information generally
    is granted by this confidentiality agreement or any disclosure of
    Information hereunder.

4.  Information may be made available to ++[directors and]{.mark}++
    employees within your organisation (including ++[directors
    and]{.mark}++ employees of subsidiaries and affiliates) and to
    ++[shareholders, potential syndicate members or]{.mark}++ external
    consultants who are directly involved in the Proposed Transaction --
    in each case to the extent that in the course of their professional
    duties they reasonably require access to Information for the
    purposes of evaluating, negotiating or advising you upon the
    Proposed Transaction - (such persons each a **'Permitted
    Recipient'**), as long as the confidential nature of the Information
    has been made clear to the Permitted Recipient(s) prior to making
    available such Information. Furthermore, you will procure that,
    prior to making Information available, the Permitted Recipients are
    made aware of the terms of this confidentiality agreement. You
    remain fully responsible and accountable for the compliance of the
    Permitted Recipients with the provisions of this confidentiality
    agreement, ++ [except for clause 11 and 12]{.mark}++.

5.  Certain items of Information which may be subsequently provided to
    you may, by reason of their nature and the fact that you or any of
    your Affiliates are or is, as the case may be, a competitor or
    potential competitor of the Group, require the Providers to obtain
    further undertakings from you in order to protect the goodwill of
    the Group and/or for reasons of competition law, and the provision
    of such confidential Information will be conditional upon the
    receipt by the Providers of such undertakings.

6.  This confidentiality agreement has no bearing on information which
    at the time of supply is in or comes into the public domain other
    than as a result of breach of this confidentiality agreement, is
    already in or comes into your lawful possession without breach of
    this confidentiality agreement (as evidenced by you by written
    records) and/or which is independently developed in good faith by
    you, your employees, or your representatives who did not have access
    to the Information.

7.  You agree to (i) immediately inform CFI and the Sellers upon
    becoming aware of any actual or reasonably imminent use or
    disclosure of Information in breach of the terms of this
    confidentiality agreement, and (ii) take, at your own expense, all
    reasonable measures to prevent the Permitted Recipients from
    prohibited or unauthorised disclosure.

8.  Information, including, but not limited to, any public announcement
    with respect to the Potential Transaction, shall be made public only
    with the prior written consent of the Seller(s), except to the
    extent disclosure is required by law, regulation or by any competent
    judicial, governmental, supervisory or regulatory authority. If
    disclosure is required by law, regulation or by any competent
    judicial, governmental, supervisory or regulatory authority, you
    will inform CFI and the Seller(s) thereof as soon as possible (and,
    to the extent reasonably practicable, before complying with such
    request) and consult, except to the extent prohibited by law,
    regulation or competent judicial, governmental, supervisory or
    regulatory authority, CFI and the Seller(s) on the proposed form,
    scope, timing, contents and purpose of the announcement so that the
    Company or the Sellers may seek a protective order or any other
    appropriate remedy or may waive compliance with certain provisions
    of this confidentiality agreement (as appreciated in our sole and
    absolute discretion). In the event that such protective order or
    other remedy is not obtained or in case compliance with certain
    provisions of this confidentiality agreement is waived, only that
    portion of the Information that is strictly legally required to be
    disclosed will be disclosed (where legally and reasonably possible,
    after consultation with us) and you will, and ++[use best efforts
    to]{.mark} ++procure that the Permitted Recipients will, (i) use
    best efforts to obtain a protective order or other reliable
    assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the
    Information, and (ii) use best efforts to comply with the
    instructions of the Company or the Sellers as to the contents of the
    Information to be disclosed and the manner of such disclosure.

9.  All Information provided to you, as well as any copies (including
    soft copies) of that Information, will be returned, destroyed and/or
    permanently removed from any computer or other electronic or storage
    device containing the Information, to the extent technically
    feasible with reasonable effort and permitted by law, in any event
    and without delay upon the first request of CFI and/or the
    Seller(s). On request, you will certify that all such Information
    has been returned, destroyed or permanently removed. The obligation
    to return or destroy Information shall not apply to [++(i)
    Information and elaborations thereof as have been saved to
    electronic carriers under automatic archiving or data security
    procedures, (ii) reports, notes or other materials prepared by you
    or on your behalf which incorporate Information (the '**Secondary
    Information**'), (iii)]{.mark} ++ the retention of Information,
    which is required by any applicable law or regulation, provided that
    to the extent that any Information++ [or Secondary
    Information]{.mark} ++is not so returned or destroyed, the
    Information ++ [or Secondary Information]{.mark} ++ shall remain
    subject to the terms of this confidentiality agreement.

10. No Information made available to you will constitute an offer or
    invitation for the sale or purchase of securities or assets. You
    acknowledge and agree that the Information does not purport to be
    all inclusive or exhaustive, that no representation or warranty,
    express or implied, has been or will be made by the Providers as to
    the accuracy, reliability or completeness of any of the Information,
    that the Providers disclaim any and all liability that may be based
    on the Information and that you are responsible for making your own
    independent investigation and evaluation of such Information. None
    of the Providers shall be under any obligation to provide further
    Information, update any of the Information provided to you or to
    correct any inaccuracies or owes any duty of care to you or any
    other person.

    written above, you will neither directly nor indirectly approach
    \--nor have a third party approach \--any employee or independent
    service provider, including those in a managerial or key position
    within the Group \--or within one of its associated companies or
    subsidiaries\-- with regard to a job within your company or an
    associated company or subsidiary of your company, employ or
    otherwise conduct talks with the intent of arriving at a contract of
    engagement without the prior written consent of Seller(s) and the
    Group. You will make sure to keep your anonymity (by setting your
    browsing settings as such), when checking any social media profiles
    (including, but not limited to, LinkedIn) of the employees or
    independent service providers of the Group.\-- Except for those in a
    managerial or key position within the Group, \--These restrictions
    will not apply to contact an employee or independent service
    provider: (i) whom responds to any general solicitation for
    employment that is not specifically directed at any such team
    member, (ii) following an unsolicited approach by that employee or
    independent service provider at his own instigation or in response
    to a general media advertisement (including general advertising via
    periodicals, the Internet and other media), (iii) whom was in
    discussions regarding possible employment with you prior to the
    signing of this agreement, and/or (iv) whose employment or
    engagement has been terminated by the Group prior to commencement of
    employment or engagement discussions between you and such employee.

12. You agree not to,\-- and procure that no Permitted Recipient
    will,\--without the prior written consent of CFI or the Sellers,
    contact any current or former directors, officers, employees,
    agents, advisers or other representatives of the Group or the
    Sellers nor any customers, distributors, suppliers, clients,
    lenders, shareholders or other counterparts of the Group in
    connection with the Proposed Transaction or any other person in
    circumstances that are reasonably likely to give rise to suspicions
    that a possible transaction is being planned or contemplated. ++ You
    shall not be deemed to have breached this obligation in the event of
    contact in the ordinary course of business, for other purposes than
    in connection with the Proposed Transaction. ++

13. You agree not to, without CFI or the Sellers' prior written consent,
    have any communication, or enter into or maintain any arrangement
    with any potential acquirer, or any representative, manager or
    adviser of any potential acquirer, in each case in relation to
    making a joint proposal (or forming any kind of consortium or other
    co-operation arrangement), either directly or indirectly, in
    relation to any potential acquisition of, or investment in, some or
    all of the business and assets or the shares of, the Company or any
    member of the Group.

14. You agree that the Providers will suffer loss and damage if the
    Information is used or disclosed other than as permitted by this
    confidentiality agreement and monetary damages alone would not be an
    adequate remedy for any breach of this confidentiality agreement.
    Accordingly, you agree that the Providers shall be entitled to
    enforce any provision of this confidentiality agreement by means of
    a claim for specific performance or via immediate injunctive relief
    before the competent court in order to prevent any breach or any
    threatened breach of this confidentiality agreement.

15. You acknowledge and accept that the Providers reserve the right,
    without advance notice and in their sole and absolute discretion, to
    terminate access to the Information by you without any right to
    compensation (including, but not limited to, any costs you have made
    in relation to the Proposed Transaction), damages or break fees in
    connection with the Proposed Transaction.

16. Until a definitive agreement has been reached with you with regard
    to any Proposed Transaction with all or part of the Group, neither
    you nor any Provider is bound to or obliged by any agreement other
    than this confidentiality agreement.

17. \--The undertakings given by you under this confidentiality
    agreement are given to the Company but are also for the benefit of
    each other Provider, as an irrevocable third-party stipulation for
    no consideration (*onherroepelijk derdenbeding om niet*).\--

18. You are not allowed to require any financial institution to grant
    exclusivity in connection with the financing of the Proposed
    Transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
    confidentiality agreement shall prevent any bank, financial
    institution or service provider of financing from dedicating a team
    of individuals to work exclusively on your behalf in connection with
    the Proposed Transaction.

19. \--You acknowledge and confirm that you are acting on your own
    behalf and not as agent, nominee, trustee, broker or as part of a
    syndicate or consortium and that you envisage to consummate the
    Proposed Transaction yourself in its entirety.\--

20. The provision of Information pursuant to this confidentiality
    agreement and any discussions held in connection with the Proposed
    Transaction are on a non-exclusive basis. The Sellers, the Company
    and CFI shall be free to pursue discussions or negotiations and to
    enter into a transaction concerning the Group with any third party.
    No discussion held or Information provided by or on behalf of the
    Sellers, the Group or any of their representatives shall constitute
    any commitment to enter into any transaction of whatever nature. The
    Sellers, the Company and CFI have the right at their sole
    discretion, without giving reasons therefore, at any time to amend
    or terminate the process, to terminate discussions with you, to
    reject any and all proposals, to (continue to) follow different
    procedures with respect to different interested parties and/or to
    negotiate with or furnish any information regarding the Group to any
    other party, without giving any (prior) notice to you and without
    liability for any losses or costs incurred by you or your
    representatives.

21. \--You shall not directly or indirectly assign or transfer or
    purport to assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under
    this confidentiality agreement without the prior written consent of
    the Company\--. ++You and ++the Company are entitled to assign or
    transfer (any of its rights under) this confidentiality agreement to
    any of its affiliates or third parties from time to time.

22. This confidentiality agreement is valid for a period of two years
    from the date written above, provided that upon completion of the
    Proposed Transaction with you, your obligations will, so far as they
    relate only to the Group, terminate.

23. The agreement created by acceptance of this confidentiality
    agreement and any contractual or non-contractual obligations arising
    out of or in connection to it, shall be governed by and construed in
    accordance with the laws of \--the Netherlands\-- ++Belgium++. Any
    disputes arising out of or in connection with this confidentiality
    agreement shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
    ++courts++ \--District Court\-- in --Amsterdam\-- ++Antwerp,
    division Antwerp, Belgium++ \-- the Netherlands\--.
