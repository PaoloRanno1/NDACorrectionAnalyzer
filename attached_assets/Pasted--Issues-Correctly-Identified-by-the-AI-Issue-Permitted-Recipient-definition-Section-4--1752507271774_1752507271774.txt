{"Issues Correctly Identified by the AI":[{"Issue":"Permitted Recipient definition","Section":"4)","Priority":"High","Analysis":"AI proposed expanding the definition of 'Permitted Recipient' to include shareholders, potential syndicate members, and other finance providers. HR implemented this by adding directors, shareholders, and potential syndicate members."},{"Issue":"Return & Destruction of Information clause","Section":"9)","Priority":"High","Analysis":"AI proposed adding exceptions for information retained on automated backup systems and internal work product. HR implemented these specific exceptions, bringing the clause into full compliance with Policy 3."},{"Issue":"Non-solicitation clause scope","Section":"11)","Priority":"High","Analysis":"AI proposed removing the non-solicitation clause's improper extension to Strada's affiliates. HR implemented this by removing the restriction on approaching employees of associated companies or subsidiaries."},{"Issue":"Prohibition on consortiums/joint proposals","Section":"19)","Priority":"High","Analysis":"AI proposed deleting the clause explicitly prohibiting forming a consortium or making a joint proposal. HR implemented this by deleting the entire clause in Section 19."},{"Issue":"No-contact provision scope","Section":"12)","Priority":"Medium","Analysis":"AI proposed adding an exception to the no-contact provision for contacts made in the ordinary course of business. HR implemented this by adding a clause allowing contact for purposes other than the Proposed Transaction."},{"Issue":"Third-party beneficiary clause","Section":"17)","Priority":"Medium","Analysis":"AI proposed deleting the clause granting enforceable rights to non-signatories. HR implemented this by deleting the entire third-party beneficiary clause."},{"Issue":"One-sided assignment clause","Section":"21)","Priority":"Medium","Analysis":"AI proposed allowing mutual assignment to affiliates. HR implemented a mutual assignment clause, but it is broader than suggested, allowing assignment to 'third parties' in addition to affiliates."},{"Issue":"Liability for Permitted Recipients","Section":"8)","Priority":"Low","Analysis":"AI proposed changing the strict liability for breaches by Permitted Recipients to an efforts-based standard. HR implemented this by adding 'use best efforts to' for procuring actions from Permitted Recipients."},{"Issue":"Governing law and jurisdiction","Section":"23)","Priority":"Low","Analysis":"AI proposed changing the governing law and jurisdiction to Belgium and Antwerp courts. HR implemented this exact change, aligning with Strada's preference."}],"Issues Missed by the AI":[{"Issue":"Reduced liability for Permitted Recipients (specific carve-out)","Section":"4.","Priority":"Medium","Analysis":"AI did not mention this specific carve-out. HR added an exception stating Strada is not responsible for its Representatives' compliance with the non-solicitation clauses (11 and 12)."}],"Issues Flagged by AI but Not Addressed by HR":[{"Issue":"Missing liability limitation clause","Section":"N/A","Priority":"High","Analysis":"The AI flagged the absence of a clause limiting liability to proven, direct damages and excluding indirect, consequential, special, or punitive damages, which exposes Strada to unacceptable financial risk. HR did not add any such general liability limitation."},{"Issue":"Incomplete exceptions to 'Information' definition","Section":"6)","Priority":"Low","Analysis":"The AI noted that the exceptions to 'Information' were incomplete, specifically missing the standard market exception for information received from a third party not under a confidentiality obligation. HR did not address this omission."}]}
